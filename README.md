# AntSimulator

Very simple ants simulator.

# Installation

## Prerequisites

In order to compile this project you will need to:
 - have [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php) installed on your system. If you don't know how to do it see [this link](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/#getting-started).
 - have [CMake](https://cmake.org/) installed

## Compilation

Detailed explanation [here](https://preshing.com/20170511/how-to-build-a-cmake-based-project/)

### On Linux with `install.sh`
- Go in the repo folder

`cd the/repo/location`

- Execute `install.sh` script

`./install.sh`

### On Windows with CMake GUI and Visual Studio
 - Install the right SFML version or compile it. To try out SFML separately see [this](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-vc.php) but for now you only need to download the correct version and extract the SFML directory into this project.
 - Run CMake
 - Select the repo location and the SFML location. The SFML location is something like `SFML-2.5.1-windows-vc15-64-bit/SFML-2.5.1/lib/cmake/SFML`.

![Cmake 2](https://github.com/johnBuffer/AntSimulator/blob/master/img/cmake_2.PNG)
 - Click on `Finish`
 - Click on `Generate`

![Cmake 3](https://github.com/johnBuffer/AntSimulator/blob/master/img/cmake_3.PNG)
 - You can now open the generated project and build it.
